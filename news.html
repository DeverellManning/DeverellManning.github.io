      <h4><u>Christmas Update</u></h4>
      <p><b>It's Christmas,</b><br> and that means something special.  As seen on the message on my homepage, I have redone my hompage's styling for Christmas!  As far as content goes, 
        I have the Art peice planned, and it <i>should</i> appear on my website by Christmas.  I think we will all like it!  We <i>may</i> have a minecraft build or special article coming, if I have the time.  <br>Anyway, get ready, and enjoy what I've gotten so far!</p>
      PS: My gallery is under construction again, as it is having loading/pop-out problems, so I'll try to fix that soon.

      <h3>News on 9/16/2021 8:17  -  Deverell Manning</h3>
      <p>Hello! This is where I'm now going to put news, whether it's important,<br> or unimpotant.
        <br><b>To get started:</b></p>
  </p><b>First off,</b> I'm constantly busy with school, family-related work, (Garden work, chores, etc.) <br>
  and many differing projects.<br> So, I put this here to let you all know, this site isn't forgotten!</p>
  <p><b>On a random note:</b><br>
    I recently found out about these webcomics, and started trying to read them:<br>
    - <a href="https://ozyandmillie.org/">Ozy and Millie</a><br>
    - <a href="https://realmofowls.com/">Realm of Owls</a><br>
    - <a href="http://www.rhjunior.com/comics/tales-of-the-questor/">Tales of the Questor</a><br>
    - <a href="http://www.rhjunior.com/comics/the-probability-bomb/">The Probability Bomb</a><br>
    - <a href="https://www.precociouscomic.com/">Precocious</a><br>
    (As far as I know, some of these are fairly obscure, so great job finding them!)</p>
    <b>Thats it for now,</b> so I hope you come back in about two months!
