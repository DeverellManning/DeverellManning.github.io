<h3 id="Who">Who Am I?</h3>
	<p>My name is Deverell Manning.  It’s not my real name, but, on the internet, I go by Deverell Manning.  You don’t need to know my real name, or where I live, or my exact age.  I’m school aged, and live somewhere in the US.  I fulfill the role of a son and brother in my family.  I like to create things, so art, writing, building, programming, etc.  I have learned to program in C++, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.  I like to read, and also play video games.  My favorite game is Minecraft.</p>

	<p>If you want to contact me, Soon I will set up a system for that to happen.  I can’t just put my email on the site, because I could get spam then, and I’d rather not.  So, you can wait until I can think of a way.  If you have any ideas, please comment below!</p>

	<h3>A brief history of Feltrush Laundry</h3>
	<p>In October of 2020, I started my website as DeverellManning.github.io.  I found Github Pages as a free web host.  That's when I made my github account.  Four years, that was all I used Github for.  In addition, my knowledge of Web Development and Servers was at a -- beginers level.  Soon, I realized that Github pages had limitations.  Like, it's just a web server.  I don't have access to it, just a static website in a git repo.  That was all fine at the time, but eventually I wanted to move.</p>
	<p>During those 4 years, I learned many things.  This website went through several iterations.  It now looks fancier than ever.  Although I wrote a great style sheet, it has been seriously lacking in content.  Prior to the move to xepher.net, I spent a week redesigning the entire site.  In order to solve my content problem, I decided I needed to do two things.  One, open up my site to a much larger vareity of content, and Two, creating a system to quickly create new pages with out spending so much time manging everything.  That pretty much brings us up to date, I'm looking forward to the move!</p>
