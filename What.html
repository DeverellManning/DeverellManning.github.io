</p><p>The terms Inuit and Eskimo are the names applied to the 
Arctic-adapted populations who live in the region extending all the way 
from eastern Siberia to Greenland. Biological, linguistic and 
archaeological evidence indicates that these people (and the Aleuts of 
the Aleutian Islands) are distinct from all the other aboriginal 
populations of the Americas and probably derive from a more recent 
population movement out of Asia. Today the term "Eskimo" is widely 
thought to mean "eaters of raw meat" and to be rather insulting—in fact,
 that's probably not what it means although the exact source of the word
 isn't clear [to learn more, try <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Eskimo" target="_blank">here</a>].
 The term "Inuit" is also used by some people to describe all these 
populations although it is only in the dialects of some of the groups 
who live in the Canadian Arctic that this word is used for 
self-designation. </p><p>All human populations in the Arctic have of 
necessity relied on animal resources to a far greater extent than 
foraging populations anywhere else in the world. Most human adaptations 
have included a reliance on both terrestrial and marine resources, 
either through an annual round encompassing land and sea or through 
trade. Over time the Eskimo developed a distinctive and complex 
technological adaptation to this region and these resources, including 
such things as snowhouses, toggling harpoons, large and small 
watercraft, drag floats, and dog traction.</p><p>Arctic Archaeology seeks to trace the development of this distinctive way of life. This development has not ceased, as these <a href="inuit_fig_holman.html">photographs of contemporary Inuit communities</a> will attest. </p><p id="primarycontarea" style="position: 10%;">
