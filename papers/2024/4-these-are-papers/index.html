I'm back.  What you clicked on brought you here.  I've been doing a bunch of stuff, but I realize that it's just to hard to put it on my webite.  So, I made papers!  Using this format, it's easier to publish content.  These papers are managed by a bunch of bash scripts I'm writing.  I can run a script to make a new paper, and all of the templating and indexes are taken care of.  Then I can just write the content.  The papers are all linked to eachother, in the topbar, so you can read them chronologically.  Later, I will also add other indexes, like my gallery.

<h4>Qualifications for a Paper</h4>
<p>
To ensure that each paper is worth reading, I'm have a minimum standard for new papers.  To write a new paper, it has to have at least a paragraph of text, or a large picture with a description.  Most papers won't have much side content, and will mainly be on one topic.  For papers presenting my art, they only need the picture and a description.  The point of all of this is that I can present my projects on a website with out having to spend hours maintaining it.  Basically minimal maintenance and maximum ease of content creation.
