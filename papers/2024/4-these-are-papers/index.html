Hi!  I'm back.  Over the last few years, I've done a bunch of projects, but I've realized that it's just too hard to put them on my website.  So, to solve this problem, I made papers!  Using this new format, it's easier for me to publish content.  The papers are all linked to each other in the topbar, so you can read them chronologically.  Soon I'll make indexes, similar to my gallery, that organize the papers automatically.  This is done based on tags.  When I write a new paper, the system will update indexes, the site map, and main page to provide access to the new paper.

<h4>Qualifications for a Paper</h4>
<p>
To ensure that each paper is worth reading, I have a standard for new papers.  To write a new paper, it needs at least a paragraph of text, or a picture with a description.  Papers don't need to have side content, and should stick to one topic.  Papers presenting art only need an image and a description.  The point of this is so I can present my projects on my website with out having to spend so much time maintaining it.  Essentially minimal maintenance and maximum speed of content presentation.

	<h4>How does it work?</h4>
These papers are managed by a bunch of bash scripts I'm working on.  Currently, I have just the script to create a paper.  When I run the script, it takes care of all of the templating for me.  Then I can just write the content!  The rest of the system is not finished yet, but soon much of the site can be automatically updated.
