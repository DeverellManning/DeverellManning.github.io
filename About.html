<h3 id="Basic">Main Idea</h3>
	<p>
	First of all: I am Deverell Manning, and I started this website in October 2020 using Github Pages.
	</p>
	<h3 id="What">What’s on my website?</h3>
	<p>
	I am planning on a number of things to be on here:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>My projects, such as EligoTextum/HOUSE.</li>
	<li>Articles/Essays</li>
	<li>Resources and links.</li>
	<li>An art show?</li>
	<li>Public files.</li>
	<li>Pages about Minecraft.</li>
	<li>Info about How I made this site.</li>
	<li>Maybe clubs/ societies info.</li>
	<li>Basically, things I (and my friends) are interested in.</li>
	</ul>

<h3 id="Who">Who Am I?</h3>
	<p>My name is Deverell Manning.  It’s not my real name, but, on the internet, I go by Deverell Manning.  You don’t need to know my real name, or where I live, or my exact age.  I’m school aged, and live somewhere in the US.  I fulfill the role of a son and brother in my family.  I like to create things, so art, writing, building, programming, etc.  I have learned to program in C++, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.  I like to read, and also play video games.  My favorite game is Minecraft.</p>

	<p>If you want to contact me, Soon I will set up a system for that to happen.  I can’t just put my email on the site, because I could get spam then, and I’d rather not.  So, you can wait until I can think of a way.  If you have any ideas, please comment below!</p>

<h3 id="Why">Why did I make this Website?</h3>
	I made this site for many reasons.  Some are listed, roughly in order of importance:
<ul>I just wanted to make my own website, for fun.</ul>
<ul>I wanted to have an independent place on the internet where I could post whatever I want.</ul>
<ul>I wanted to have a place to hold information, maybe sell things, and maybe a Minecraft server.</ul>
<ul>I wanted to experiment with HTML.</ul>
